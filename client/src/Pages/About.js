              WorkMate started in 2024 with a one Idea. A lot has changed since
              then but our goals remain the same; connect clients to our
              community of expert freelancers who are available to hire by the
              hour or project; provide flexibility to work when it suits you,
              outside the archaic 9-to-5 day; and enable people to live their
              work dream.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>

              freelancers â€” We think we might be onto something.
